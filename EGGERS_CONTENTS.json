{"home":{"content":"# [Hello, Wrold!](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/console-log-hello-wrold-3e3abeb44396#.5xosqmkkj)\n---\n\nI'm Taq - software engineer at [Honey](https://honey.is/). I've also taught **FEWD** a bunch of times and generally hang around GA way more than I probably should.\n\n#### Overview/Mains Points of Discussion\n---\nOur main plan for today is to have a discussion about ES6 and where it lives in our particular tech stack. Here are some of the overarching items I'll be touching on today:\n\n1. Is ES6 __actually__ useful?\n2. How is ES6 being used in our stack (if at all).\n3. What we look for when we hire javascript engineers.\n4. Where to go from here as JS tumbles towards ES2017, etc.\n\n#### Stuff I'll be talking about\n---\nHere are some of the stuff I'll be touching on in my talk.\n\n#### This isn't one _those_ talks\n* Don't really expect to get too much into the weeds of the technical aspects of ES6.\n* I'm fairly certain we're all good at googling things.\n\n#### Promises: I like this\n**Example Use Case**: [GitBot](http://gitbot.co)\n* Promises are pretty great.\n* Being able to go from **pathUrl** -> **requestObject** -> **htmlString** in a concise and readable manner is pretty great.\n* Here is my **[favorite Promise based code snippet](https://gist.github.com/mottaquikarim/09e4e21db6dddda677f5)**.\n\n#### Generators\n**Example Use Case**: [AlgEE](http://algee-honeytweet.rhcloud.com/#/problem/1/1)\n\n* IMO, more useful as iterators than as some sort of holy-grail Promise killer.\n* **[Interesting snippet](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28032438)** illustrating useful generator concept.\n* Syntax is a little harder to read and reason about.\n\n#### ES6 + Honey\n\n* Some background on our app: SPA-style web client built before SPAs were really a thing.\n* Our stack and the state of our JavaScript.\n* How we build our JS and challenges faced with building / watching\n* Babel and our plans on integrating into our processes\n* When we will start implementing ES2017.\n* **[Important read](https://bocoup.com/weblog/javascript-developers-watch-your-language)**\n\n#### What we really look for in JS Engineers\n* Understanding how JS/the web works on a fundamental level\n* My favorite interview question to ask candidates\n\n\n\n","idx":0},"__list__":["home"]}
